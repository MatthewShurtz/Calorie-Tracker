      <h3 class="app-use-title">Why So Simple?</h3>
      <p class="app-use">
        Looking at the world of nutrutional science, it's easy to get
        overwhelmed and confused with the conflicting information. The case has
        been made by varying proponents to go low-carb, vegan, carnivore,
        low-fat, keto, Atkins, Mediterranean, vegetarian, ect. I want to tell
        you a little secret that really isn't a secret. You ready? They all
        work. Shocked? I was. I used to be a huge advocate of low-carb and in
        some degree I still am. But I have been more convince of the importance
        of knowing how much food you eat.
      </p>
      <p class="app-use">
        The research, at least in my opinion, has shown that it doesn't really
        matter what you eat but rather how much you eat. It doesn't matter if
        you are

        If this is true, then the only number we should concern ourselves with
        is the number of total calories we consume.
      </p>
      <p class="app-use">
        I understand if the idea of counting your calories is a chore but it can
        be really revealing as the amount of food you are eating. You can also
        identify some eating patterns. Do you eat more on the weekends? Do you
        have a small breakfast but a giant dinner? Do you snack a lot? Do you
        consume a lot calories through beavages? Did something happen this week
        that sent you into a food frenzy? All of these question can be answer
        simply through tracking. You are you own scientist and test subject. So
        how can this simple web app help? Good question
      </p>
      <h3 class="app-use-title">How to Use This App</h3>
      <p class="app-use">
        This app does is add your total calories from the day. There are a
        couple ways you can maximize its use. One, you can write down everything
        you eat during the day and after you have had your last meal simple add
        the food and number of calories into the respective field. Two, you can
        write everything down you eat along with the number of calories then
        after your last meal you can add them to this app and it will calories.
        I would suggest the first method for a week just to get a sense of what
        you are eating. After that, you can choose either method. You can keep
        track through a few methods. You can use a piece of paper and a
        pen/pencil, you can enter everything on a note app on your phone, or you
        can use your calendar that way you can see how many calories you ate on
        a particular day.

      <p class="app-use">
        For a quick reference on the number of calories in a food item, here is
        a couple of sources to help you figure that out.
        <a
          href="https://www.uncledavesenterprise.com/file/health/Food%20Calories%20List.pdf"
          target="_blank"
          class="link"
          >The first is a pdf.
        </a>
        You hit the cmd+f/alt+f to bring up the find box. For example, when you
        pull up the pdf, hit the cmd+f/alt+f and type in apple. You will see
        "apple" is highlighted. Note that the portion size might need to be
        caluculated as well.
